    title: 'The Discovery of the Stratosphere - A Balloon Adventure',
    content: "Imagine it's 1902, and French meteorologist Léon Teisserenc de Bort has been launching weather balloons for YEARS, expecting temperature to keep dropping as they rise. But something weird keeps happening - at about 11 kilometers up, the temperature STOPS falling! In fact, it starts getting WARMER again! This made no sense! Everyone thought the atmosphere was just one uniform layer getting colder and colder. After launching over 200 balloons and confirming his crazy findings, he announced: \"There are TWO layers!\" He named the lower layer the TROPOSPHERE ('turning sphere' where weather happens) and the upper layer the STRATOSPHERE ('layered sphere'). Scientists mocked him - until they sent their own balloons and found he was RIGHT! Today we know there are FIVE layers, each with its own personality. The stratosphere even has a secret weapon - the OZONE LAYER - that shields us from deadly UV radiation. Thanks to his stubborn balloon experiments, we discovered our planet has layers like an onion!",

    },
    {
      term: 'Stratosphere',
      definition: 'The atmospheric layer above the troposphere (12-50 km) containing the ozone layer',

      title: 'The Five Layers: Earth\'s Atmospheric Onion',
      explanation: "Earth's atmosphere has five distinct layers, each with unique characteristics. Going up from Earth's surface: Troposphere → Stratosphere → Mesosphere → Thermosphere → Exosphere.",
      analogy: {
        type: 'Building Floors',
        description: 'Think of the atmosphere as a five-story building:\n• Ground floor (Troposphere): Where everyone lives, all the action happens - weather, clouds, birds\n• 2nd floor (Stratosphere): The "calm" floor where planes cruise and ozone protects us\n• 3rd floor (Mesosphere): The "meteor destroyer" floor where shooting stars burn up\n• 4th floor (Thermosphere): The "hot" floor where auroras dance and space station orbits\n• Rooftop (Exosphere): Where atmosphere meets space - molecules are escaping to space!'

      whyYouCare: 'Every breath you take comes from the troposphere. Every plane flight relies on the calm stratosphere. The mesosphere protects you from meteor bombardment. The thermosphere reflects radio waves that let you listen to distant radio stations. Without these layers working together, Earth would be uninhabitable!'

    {
      title: 'Atmospheric Composition: The Air We Breathe',
      explanation: "Air isn't just one thing - it's a mixture of gases. Dry air is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, plus traces of other gases and water vapor.",
      analogy: {
        type: 'Cookie Recipe',
        description: 'If air were a cookie recipe:\n• 78 cups of nitrogen (the flour - takes up most space but doesn\'t do much)\n• 21 cups of oxygen (the sugar - the sweet part we need to survive!)\n• 1 cup of argon (vanilla extract - there but you barely notice)\n• A pinch of CO₂ (salt - tiny amount, huge impact on flavor/climate)\n• Variable water vapor (chocolate chips - amount changes, makes it interesting!)'

    {
      title: 'The Ozone Layer: Earth\'s Sunscreen',
      explanation: "In the stratosphere (20-30km up), there's a region with higher concentrations of ozone (O₃). This 'ozone layer' absorbs 97-99% of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.",
      analogy: {

        description: 'The ozone layer is like an invisible force field protecting Earth. UV radiation from the Sun is like cosmic bullets - the ozone molecules sacrifice themselves by absorbing the UV (breaking apart), then reforming. It\'s a shield that constantly repairs itself! Without it, going outside would be like standing in front of a tanning bed 24/7.'

    {
      title: 'Air Pressure: The Invisible Weight',
      explanation: "Air has mass, and gravity pulls it down, creating pressure. At sea level, air pressure is about 101,325 Pa (14.7 psi). Pressure decreases as you go up because there's less air above you.",
      analogy: {
        type: 'Swimming Pool',
        description: 'Imagine a deep swimming pool. At the bottom, you feel LOTS of pressure from all the water above you. Near the surface, there\'s less water above, so less pressure. Air works the same way! At sea level, you have the entire atmosphere\'s weight pressing down. At mountain tops, there\'s less air above you, so less pressure (and less oxygen - hence altitude sickness!).'

        'Water boils at lower temperatures at high altitude (90°C in Denver vs 100°C at sea level) because of lower pressure'
      ],
      whyYouCare: 'Understanding air pressure explains why your chips bag puffs up on mountain drives, why weather forecasters talk about "high" and "low" pressure systems, and why astronauts need pressurized suits in space (near-zero pressure would make your blood boil!).'

  workedExamples: [
    {
      scenario: 'The Mystery of the Backwards Temperature',
      problemSetup: 'A weather balloon measures temperature as it rises. From 0-12km, temperature drops from 15°C to -60°C. But from 12-50km (stratosphere), temperature RISES back to 0°C! Why does this happen?',

        {
          step: 1,
          description: 'Understand troposphere temperature drop',
          reasoning: 'In the troposphere, temperature drops because you\'re getting farther from Earth\'s surface (which is heated by the Sun). Earth radiates heat upward, but the higher you go, the less heat reaches you.'
        },
        {
          step: 2,
          description: 'Identify what\'s different in the stratosphere',
          reasoning: 'The stratosphere contains the OZONE LAYER. Ozone (O₃) absorbs UV radiation from the Sun and converts it to HEAT. This is why temperature increases with altitude here!'

        {
          step: 3,
          description: 'Connect to layer stability',
          reasoning: 'Because warm air is on TOP in the stratosphere (reversed from normal), there\'s no convection or mixing. Warm air doesn\'t sink, cold air doesn\'t rise. This creates a SUPER stable layer - perfect for airplane flight! No turbulence.'
        }
      ],
      solution: 'The stratosphere warms with altitude because ozone absorbs UV radiation and converts it to heat. This "backwards" temperature profile makes it extremely stable - which is why commercial jets fly here at 10-12km. No storms, no turbulence, smooth sailing!',
      realWorldApplication: 'This is why pilots fly in the lower stratosphere - the stability saves fuel, reduces wear on aircraft, and gives passengers a smoother ride. Understanding atmospheric layers literally keeps you safe during flight!'

      scenario: 'The Ozone Hole Disaster (And Victory!)',
      problemSetup: 'In 1985, British scientists discovered the ozone layer over Antarctica had thinned by 40% - a massive "hole"! How did humans cause this, and how did we fix it?',

          step: 1,
          description: 'Identify the culprit',
          reasoning: 'Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from spray cans, refrigerators, and air conditioners were rising to the stratosphere. Each CFC molecule could destroy 100,000 ozone molecules! CFCs were invented in the 1920s and thought to be "harmless".'
        },
        {
          step: 2,
          description: 'Understand the chemical destruction',
          reasoning: 'UV light breaks apart CFCs, releasing chlorine atoms. Chlorine acts as a CATALYST: Cl + O₃ → ClO + O₂, then ClO + O → Cl + O₂. The chlorine atom is FREE again to destroy another ozone molecule - it\'s a chain reaction!'
        },
        {
          step: 3,
          description: 'The global solution',
          reasoning: 'In 1987, every nation on Earth signed the Montreal Protocol, agreeing to phase out CFCs. Companies developed alternatives (HFCs, which don\'t harm ozone). The ozone hole is now SHRINKING and expected to fully recover by 2070!'
        }
      ],
      solution: 'Human-made chemicals (CFCs) were destroying the ozone layer. Global cooperation (Montreal Protocol) banned them, and the ozone layer is now healing. This proves humanity CAN solve environmental crises when we work together!',
