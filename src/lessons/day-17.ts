    title: 'William Henry and the Mystery of Fizzy Water',
    content: "Picture London, 1803. Chemist William Henry is obsessed with carbonated water - the new fizzy drink craze sweeping England. Everyone knows that bubbles escape when you open a bottle, but WHY? And why does warm soda go flat faster than cold soda? Henry conducts meticulous experiments, varying temperature and pressure, measuring exactly how much CO₂ dissolves in water under different conditions. His discovery? MIND-BLOWING! The amount of gas that dissolves in liquid is DIRECTLY proportional to the pressure of that gas above the liquid. Double the pressure → double the dissolved gas. This became Henry's Law, and it explained EVERYTHING: Why soda bottles are pressurized (keeps CO₂ dissolved), why they fizz when opened (pressure drops, gas escapes), why scuba divers get 'the bends' (nitrogen dissolves in blood under pressure, forms bubbles when surfacing too fast - potentially deadly!). Henry's curiosity about fizzy drinks led to a fundamental law of chemistry that now saves lives in diving medicine, explains carbonation in beverages, and helps us understand ocean chemistry and climate change (oceans absorb CO₂). One scientist, one fizzy mystery, one law that changed everything! 🫧",
