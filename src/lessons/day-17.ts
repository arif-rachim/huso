    title: 'William Henry and the Mystery of Fizzy Water',
    content: "Picture London, 1803. Chemist William Henry is obsessed with carbonated water - the new fizzy drink craze sweeping England. Everyone knows that bubbles escape when you open a bottle, but WHY? And why does warm soda go flat faster than cold soda? Henry conducts meticulous experiments, varying temperature and pressure, measuring exactly how much CO‚ÇÇ dissolves in water under different conditions. His discovery? MIND-BLOWING! The amount of gas that dissolves in liquid is DIRECTLY proportional to the pressure of that gas above the liquid. Double the pressure ‚Üí double the dissolved gas. This became Henry's Law, and it explained EVERYTHING: Why soda bottles are pressurized (keeps CO‚ÇÇ dissolved), why they fizz when opened (pressure drops, gas escapes), why scuba divers get 'the bends' (nitrogen dissolves in blood under pressure, forms bubbles when surfacing too fast - potentially deadly!). Henry's curiosity about fizzy drinks led to a fundamental law of chemistry that now saves lives in diving medicine, explains carbonation in beverages, and helps us understand ocean chemistry and climate change (oceans absorb CO‚ÇÇ). One scientist, one fizzy mystery, one law that changed everything! ü´ß",
