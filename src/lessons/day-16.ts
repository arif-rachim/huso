    title: 'Gregor Mendel: The Monk Who Cracked the Code of Heredity',
    content: "Picture an Austrian monastery garden in 1856. A monk named Gregor Mendel is obsessively counting pea plants - tall ones, short ones, green ones, yellow ones. His fellow monks think he's lost his mind! But Mendel has a radical hypothesis: traits aren't just randomly mixed like paint. They're passed down in DISCRETE UNITS following mathematical rules. Over 8 years, he grows 29,000 pea plants, meticulously tracking 7 traits through multiple generations. The results? Mind-blowing! Traits don't blend - they follow predictable 3:1 ratios. When he crosses tall and short peas, ALL offspring are tall (F1), but when he crosses THOSE offspring, he gets 3 tall : 1 short (F2). He's discovered dominant and recessive traits! Mendel publishes in 1866, but nobody understands the significance. He dies in 1884, unknown and unappreciated. Then in 1900, THREE scientists independently rediscover his work and realize: this monk figured out the fundamental laws of heredity BEFORE anyone knew about genes, DNA, or chromosomes! Today, Mendel is called the 'Father of Genetics.' His pea plants revealed the code of life itself! ðŸŒ±ðŸ§¬",

        { label: 'E', text: 'Genes code for alleles' }
      ],
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a trait. Alleles are different versions of the same gene (e.g., brown eye allele vs. blue eye allele for the eye color gene).',
      storyExplanation: 'Think of a gene as a "category" (like "eye color") and alleles as "options" within that category (brown, blue, green). Same question, different answers!'

      ],
      correctAnswer: 'C',
      explanation: 'In heterozygotes (Bb), the dominant allele (B) masks the recessive allele (b), so the phenotype shows the dominant trait.',
      storyExplanation: 'Think of dominant as "loud" and recessive as "quiet". In Bb, the loud B drowns out the quiet b, so you only see B\'s trait!'

      explanation: 'Aa Ã— Aa produces genotypes: 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa. Since A is dominant, AA and Aa both show dominant phenotype (75%), only aa shows recessive (25%). Ratio = 3:1.',
      storyExplanation: 'This is Mendel\'s famous 3:1 ratio! Out of 4 offspring, 3 show dominant trait (AA, Aa, Aa) and 1 shows recessive (aa). It\'s the signature of heterozygous crosses!'

        { label: 'E', text: 'Someone who works in a hospital' }
      ],
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'A carrier is heterozygous (Dd) - they have one recessive disease allele (d) but one dominant normal allele (D). The dominant allele masks the disease, so they\'re healthy but can pass the disease allele to children.',
      storyExplanation: 'Carriers are like secret agents hiding the disease gene! They look healthy (thanks to the dominant allele) but carry the recessive disease allele that could appear in their kids if they marry another carrier.'

      explanation: 'Both Bb parents carry the recessive blue allele (b). If both pass b to the child (25% chance), the child is bb and has blue eyes. The b allele was hidden in the parents but revealed in the child.',
      storyExplanation: 'Each parent has a hidden blue allele (the quiet b). Usually it\'s masked by the loud brown B. But if BOTH parents happen to pass their quiet b to the same child - surprise blue eyes! It\'s like two carriers of a secret revealing it together.'

      whyItMatters: 'Understanding this distinction is critical for predicting inheritance and interpreting genetic tests. You can\'t determine genotype just by looking at phenotype!'
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Thinking dominant means "more common" or "better"',
      correction: 'DOMINANT just means "masks recessive in heterozygotes." It has NOTHING to do with frequency or quality. Some dominant traits are rare (Huntington\'s disease), some recessive traits are common (blue eyes in some populations).',
      whyItMatters: 'This misconception leads to misunderstanding genetics and evolution. Dominant doesn\'t mean advantageous, frequent, or superior - it\'s purely about masking relationships'
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Forgetting that heterozygotes carry the recessive allele',
      correction: 'Bb individuals show the DOMINANT phenotype but CARRY the recessive allele. They can pass that recessive allele to offspring. Two Bb parents can have bb children (25% chance).',

    {
      mistake: 'Treating Punnett square results as guarantees',
      correction: 'Punnett squares show PROBABILITIES, not certainties. A 25% chance of bb doesn\'t mean "1 in every 4 children will be bb" - each child has independent 25% chance. You could have 4 children, all Bb!',
