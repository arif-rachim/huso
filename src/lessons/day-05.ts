    title: 'Jan Ingenhousz and the Mystery of the Green Priestess',
    content: "It's 1779, and Dutch scientist Jan Ingenhousz is obsessed with a puzzle: Why do plants make bubbles in sunlight? Everyone knew plants were important, but HOW they worked was a mystery. In a brilliant experiment, he put a sprig of mint underwater in a glass jar and watched. In sunlight: BUBBLES! In darkness: NOTHING! He collected the gas and discovered it was OXYGEN - the same gas we breathe! But here's the mind-blowing part: he realized plants were doing the OPPOSITE of animals. Animals breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen! It was like discovering that plants are Earth's air purifiers, constantly cleaning the atmosphere. Then in the 1940s, scientists using radioactive tracers discovered that the oxygen plants release doesn't come from CO‚ÇÇ - it comes from WATER! Plants literally split water molecules apart using sunlight's energy. Today we know photosynthesis produces 330 billion tons of oxygen per year - that's why Earth is the only planet with breathable air!",
