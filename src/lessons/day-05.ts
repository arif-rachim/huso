    title: 'Jan Ingenhousz and the Mystery of the Green Priestess',
    content: "It's 1779, and Dutch scientist Jan Ingenhousz is obsessed with a puzzle: Why do plants make bubbles in sunlight? Everyone knew plants were important, but HOW they worked was a mystery. In a brilliant experiment, he put a sprig of mint underwater in a glass jar and watched. In sunlight: BUBBLES! In darkness: NOTHING! He collected the gas and discovered it was OXYGEN - the same gas we breathe! But here's the mind-blowing part: he realized plants were doing the OPPOSITE of animals. Animals breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen! It was like discovering that plants are Earth's air purifiers, constantly cleaning the atmosphere. Then in the 1940s, scientists using radioactive tracers discovered that the oxygen plants release doesn't come from CO₂ - it comes from WATER! Plants literally split water molecules apart using sunlight's energy. Today we know photosynthesis produces 330 billion tons of oxygen per year - that's why Earth is the only planet with breathable air!",

      explanation: "Photosynthesis is how plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. The equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. In words: carbon dioxide + water + sunlight → glucose + oxygen.",

      title: 'Factors Affecting Photosynthesis: The Limiting Factor',
      explanation: "Photosynthesis rate depends on light intensity, CO₂ concentration, water availability, and temperature. Whichever factor is in shortest supply becomes the 'limiting factor' that controls the rate.",

Even if a plant has tons of water and CO₂, if light is dim, that limits the rate. Greenhouses control ALL factors to maximize plant growth.'

      title: 'Aerobic vs Anaerobic: The Oxygen Difference',

          step: 2,
          description: 'Apply limiting factor principle',

          description: 'Explain the mechanism',
          reasoning: 'More CO₂ → more raw material for photosynthesis → faster glucose production → faster plant growth. The equation 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ shows CO₂ is a required input.'
        }

          description: 'Muscle fatigue: Anaerobic respiration kicks in',

          step: 3,
          description: 'The burn: Lactic acid buildup',
          reasoning: 'Anaerobic respiration produces lactic acid as waste. It builds up in muscles, causing the burning sensation and making muscles feel heavy. The pH drops, interfering with muscle contraction.'

          description: 'Gasping at finish: Oxygen debt',

      solution: 'Early: aerobic respiration (efficient). Later: oxygen can\'t keep up → anaerobic respiration → lactic acid buildup → muscle burn. After race: heavy breathing pays back oxygen debt and clears lactic acid.',
