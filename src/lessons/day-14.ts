    title: 'Svante Arrhenius and the Shocking Discovery of Ions',
    content: "Picture Stockholm, 1884. A 25-year-old graduate student named Svante Arrhenius has just submitted his doctoral thesis with a mind-blowing idea: when you dissolve salt in water, it BREAKS APART into electrically charged pieces called ions! His professors thought this was ridiculous. They gave him the LOWEST possible passing grade. But Arrhenius didn't give up. He proposed that acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H‚Å∫) in water, while bases release hydroxide ions (OH‚Åª). This explained EVERYTHING: why acids taste sour, why bases feel slippery, why mixing them creates water and salt! The scientific community initially mocked him, but within 20 years, everyone realized he was right. In 1903, Arrhenius won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry - the same prize his professors thought he didn't deserve! His 'failing' thesis revolutionized chemistry and gave us the foundation for understanding acids, bases, batteries, and even how our bodies regulate blood pH. Talk about the ultimate comeback story! üèÜ",

      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'Acids are defined as substances that produce hydrogen ions (H‚Å∫) when dissolved in water. This is the Arrhenius definition of acids.',
      storyExplanation: 'Think of acids as "H‚Å∫ factories" - when they dissolve in water, they break apart and release hydrogen ions. These H‚Å∫ ions are what make acids sour and reactive!'

    {
      mistake: 'Confusing strong/weak with concentrated/dilute',
      correction: 'STRONG/WEAK describes how completely the acid/base ionizes. CONCENTRATED/DILUTE describes how much is dissolved. You can have dilute strong acid or concentrated weak acid!',
      whyItMatters: 'A dilute solution of strong acid (like HCl) can still be very dangerous. "Weak" doesn\'t mean "safe" - it means incomplete ionization'

    {
      mistake: 'Thinking neutralization always gives pH exactly 7',
      correction: 'Strong acid + strong base ‚Üí pH 7, but weak acid + strong base ‚Üí pH > 7, and strong acid + weak base ‚Üí pH < 7. Only strong + strong gives exactly neutral!',
      whyItMatters: 'In titrations and industrial processes, knowing the expected final pH is crucial. Not all neutralizations end at pH 7!'

      mistake: 'Forgetting pH is logarithmic',
      correction: 'Each pH unit is 10√ó different! pH 5 is 10√ó more acidic than pH 6, and 100√ó more acidic than pH 7. Don\'t treat pH numbers like regular linear scales.',
      whyItMatters: 'Small changes in pH represent HUGE changes in acidity. Ocean pH dropping from 8.2 to 8.1 sounds tiny but it\'s a 30% increase in acidity!'
