    title: 'James Hutton: The Man Who Discovered Deep Time',
    content: "It's 1785 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Geologist James Hutton is staring at a cliff face called Siccar Point, and his mind is being BLOWN. He sees horizontal layers of sedimentary rock lying ON TOP of vertical layers - they don't match! How is this possible? Then it hits him like a lightning bolt: The bottom layers formed horizontally, were tilted by Earth's forces, eroded flat, THEN new horizontal layers formed on top. This process would take... MILLIONS OF YEARS! At a time when most people believed Earth was only 6,000 years old, Hutton realized Earth must be ANCIENT - so old that 'we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.' He discovered that rocks aren't permanent - they're constantly being destroyed and reformed in an endless cycle. Granite erodes into sediment ‚Üí sediment becomes sedimentary rock ‚Üí heat and pressure transform it into metamorphic rock ‚Üí melting creates magma ‚Üí magma cools into igneous rock ‚Üí erosion starts the cycle again! Hutton had discovered the ROCK CYCLE and 'Deep Time' - the concept that Earth operates on timescales of millions and billions of years. His revolutionary idea: Earth is a self-renewing system, constantly recycling its materials. Today we call him the 'Father of Modern Geology.' One cliff, one insight, one paradigm shift! üåã",

      correction: 'MOST sedimentary rocks are relatively soft (can scratch with knife), but some are very hard! Quartzite (metamorphosed sandstone) and well-cemented sandstone can be extremely hard.',

      mistake: 'Confusing weathering and erosion',
      correction: 'WEATHERING = breaking rocks into pieces (happens IN PLACE). EROSION = transporting those pieces away (MOVEMENT). Both are different processes!',
