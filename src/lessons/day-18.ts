    title: 'James Hutton: The Man Who Discovered Deep Time',
    content: "It's 1785 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Geologist James Hutton is staring at a cliff face called Siccar Point, and his mind is being BLOWN. He sees horizontal layers of sedimentary rock lying ON TOP of vertical layers - they don't match! How is this possible? Then it hits him like a lightning bolt: The bottom layers formed horizontally, were tilted by Earth's forces, eroded flat, THEN new horizontal layers formed on top. This process would take... MILLIONS OF YEARS! At a time when most people believed Earth was only 6,000 years old, Hutton realized Earth must be ANCIENT - so old that 'we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.' He discovered that rocks aren't permanent - they're constantly being destroyed and reformed in an endless cycle. Granite erodes into sediment → sediment becomes sedimentary rock → heat and pressure transform it into metamorphic rock → melting creates magma → magma cools into igneous rock → erosion starts the cycle again! Hutton had discovered the ROCK CYCLE and 'Deep Time' - the concept that Earth operates on timescales of millions and billions of years. His revolutionary idea: Earth is a self-renewing system, constantly recycling its materials. Today we call him the 'Father of Modern Geology.' One cliff, one insight, one paradigm shift! 🌋",

      correctAnswer: 'C',
      explanation: 'Igneous rocks form when magma (underground) or lava (at surface) cools and solidifies into rock.',

      storyExplanation: 'Imagine trying to preserve a butterfly: sedimentary (gentle burial) = preserved beautifully. Igneous (lava) = incinerated! Metamorphic (pressure/heat) = squished and melted! Only sedimentary rocks are gentle enough to preserve fossils.'

      correction: 'MOST sedimentary rocks are relatively soft (can scratch with knife), but some are very hard! Quartzite (metamorphosed sandstone) and well-cemented sandstone can be extremely hard.',

    {
      mistake: 'Confusing weathering and erosion',
      correction: 'WEATHERING = breaking rocks into pieces (happens IN PLACE). EROSION = transporting those pieces away (MOVEMENT). Both are different processes!',

      mistake: 'Thinking metamorphic rocks must be melted',

      mistake: 'Assuming the rock cycle always goes in one direction',
