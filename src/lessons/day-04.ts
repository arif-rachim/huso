    title: 'The Ancient Mystery of Prime Numbers',
    content: "Around 300 BCE, Greek mathematician Euclid proved something ASTONISHING: there are INFINITELY many prime numbers! But here's where it gets mysterious - prime numbers seem to appear randomly (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...), yet they follow hidden patterns mathematicians are STILL discovering today. Fast forward to World War II: Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park used prime number properties to crack the Nazi Enigma code, helping win the war! Today, every time you shop online or send a private message, HUGE prime numbers (hundreds of digits long!) protect your data through encryption. Banks transfer trillions of dollars daily using prime number security. The crazy part? We still don't have a formula to predict the next prime number! They're like mathematical diamonds - rare, valuable, and full of mystery. A $1 million prize STILL awaits anyone who can solve the Riemann Hypothesis about prime number distribution!",
