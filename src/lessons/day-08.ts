    title: 'Simon Stevin and the Decimal Revolution',
    content: "In 1585, Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin published a tiny 7-page booklet called 'De Thiende' (The Tenth) that changed mathematics FOREVER. His radical idea? Instead of using clunky fractions like 3/10 + 4/100, just write them as 0.34! People thought he was crazy - fractions had been used for thousands of years! But Stevin showed that decimals made calculations SO MUCH EASIER. Adding 0.25 + 0.5 is way simpler than adding 1/4 + 1/2! Within 50 years, decimals spread across Europe. Today, every calculator, computer, and phone uses Stevin's decimal system. The stock market, science, engineering - all run on decimals. And here's the mind-blowing part: decimals, fractions, and percentages are just THREE DIFFERENT WAYS to write the SAME NUMBER! 0.5 = 1/2 = 50% - same amount, different notation. It's like calling the same person by their first name, nickname, and formal title - still the same person!",
