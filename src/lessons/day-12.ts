    title: 'Al-Khwarizmi and the Birth of Algebra',
    content: "Picture this: It's 820 CE in Baghdad, and a brilliant mathematician named Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi is about to revolutionize mathematics forever. He's writing a book called 'Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala' (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing). That word 'al-jabr' would eventually become our word 'algebra'! Al-Khwarizmi realized something mind-blowing: instead of always using specific numbers, you could use symbols (letters) to represent unknown values and create general rules that work for ANY numbers. Imagine the power - one equation could solve not just one problem, but MILLIONS of similar problems! He showed merchants how to divide inheritances fairly, engineers how to design irrigation systems, and astronomers how to predict planetary movements. His revolutionary idea: mathematics isn't just about numbers you know - it's about finding numbers you DON'T know yet!",

      mistake: 'Sign errors with negative distributive',
      correction: '-2(x - 3) is NOT -2x - 6. It\'s -2x + 6 because -2 Ã— (-3) = +6',
      whyItMatters: 'Negative times negative equals positive! Missing this changes signs throughout your work and leads to wrong final answers'

    {
      mistake: 'Translating "less than" backwards',
      correction: '"5 less than x" is x - 5, NOT 5 - x. The order matters! "Less than" means subtract FROM the number mentioned after',
      whyItMatters: 'Word order in English doesn\'t always match math order. This mistake flips your equation and gives the opposite answer'
