    title: 'The Norwegian Meteorology Revolution',
    content: "During World War I, Norway was cut off from weather reports. In 1918, physicist Vilhelm Bjerknes had a brilliant idea: treat the atmosphere like a BATTLEGROUND where air masses collide! He and his team (the 'Bergen School') noticed patterns: cold air advancing like an army pushing warm air up creates clouds and rain. They coined the term 'weather FRONT' - borrowing military terminology! Their insight: weather doesn't happen randomly - it's the result of AIR MASS COLLISIONS. They mapped out four types of fronts (cold, warm, stationary, occluded) and created the symbols we still use on weather maps today. This revolutionized forecasting! Before Bjerknes, weather prediction was guesswork. After, meteorologists could predict storms days in advance. Today, weather satellites and computer models build on his foundation, but the basic idea remains: weather is air masses at war!",
