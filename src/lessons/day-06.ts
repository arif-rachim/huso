    title: 'Linus Pauling and the Nature of the Chemical Bond',
    content: "It's the 1930s, and a brilliant young chemist named Linus Pauling is puzzling over a mystery: HOW do atoms actually stick together? Everyone knew atoms formed bonds, but nobody could explain WHY or HOW. Using the brand-new science of quantum mechanics (atoms behaving like waves!), Pauling had a revolutionary insight: electrons aren't just orbiting randomly - they're SHARED between atoms like two kids holding hands! He calculated that when two atoms share electrons, they become MORE stable than alone. It's like two puzzle pieces fitting together. He even figured out that some atoms are \"greedier\" for electrons than others - he called this ELECTRONEGATIVITY. His book 'The Nature of the Chemical Bond' (1939) revolutionized chemistry! But here's the kicker: Pauling also predicted molecular SHAPES. He realized that electron pairs repel each other (like magnets with the same pole), so molecules twist into 3D shapes to keep electrons as far apart as possible. Water bends into a V-shape, methane forms a pyramid - all because electrons hate being close! For this work, Pauling won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Later, he won a SECOND Nobel Prize (Peace) for campaigning against nuclear weapons. The only person ever to win two unshared Nobel Prizes!",
