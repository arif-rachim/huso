    title: 'The Eratosthenes Calculation: Measuring Earth with Shadows and Ratios',
    content: "Picture ancient Egypt, 240 BCE. Librarian Eratosthenes in Alexandria reads that in Syene (now Aswan), 800 km south, the sun casts NO shadow at noon on the summer solstice - it's directly overhead. But in Alexandria, there IS a shadow at that exact moment. Eratosthenes has a brilliant insight: if Earth is ROUND (not flat!), the different shadow angles must be due to Earth's curvature. He measures the shadow angle in Alexandria: 7.2 degrees (about 1/50th of a full circle). Here's his genius ratio thinking: 'If 7.2¬∞ difference happens over 800 km distance, then 360¬∞ (full circle) must correspond to Earth's full circumference!' He sets up a proportion: 7.2¬∞/800 km = 360¬∞/Earth's circumference. Cross-multiplying: 7.2 √ó C = 360 √ó 800, so C = 40,000 km. His answer? Earth's circumference is about 40,000 kilometers! The ACTUAL circumference? 40,075 km. He was off by less than 1% - using just shadows, angles, and RATIOS! No satellites, no technology, just proportional reasoning. This 2,200-year-old calculation proved Earth was round AND measured its size, all thanks to understanding ratios and proportions! üåçüìê",
