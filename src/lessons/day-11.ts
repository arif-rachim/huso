    title: 'Pierre Perrault and the Quantified Water Cycle',
    content: "For thousands of years, people wondered: Where does river water come from? Some thought underground rivers fed from the ocean. Others believed water magically appeared from mountains. In 1674, French scientist Pierre Perrault did something revolutionary - he MEASURED everything! He measured rainfall in the Seine River basin for 3 years, calculated the river's flow rate, and discovered something amazing: rainfall ALONE was 6 times more than enough to account for all the river's water! This proved rivers come from RAIN, not mysterious underground sources. But the bigger revelation: water goes in a CYCLE. Ocean â†’ evaporation â†’ clouds â†’ rain â†’ rivers â†’ ocean â†’ repeat! The same water molecules have been cycling for 4 billion years. The water you drink today was once drunk by dinosaurs, used by Cleopatra, frozen in glaciers, and floated in clouds! Earth has the SAME amount of water as it did millions of years ago - it just keeps recycling. About 97% is salty ocean water, only 3% is fresh, and most of that is frozen in ice caps. The tiny amount cycling through the atmosphere (0.001% of all water!) powers all weather and sustains all life!",

      title: 'Cloud Formation: When Invisible Becomes Visible',
