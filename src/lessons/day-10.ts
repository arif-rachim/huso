    title: 'Lavoisier and the Law That Changed Everything',
    content: "In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier did something revolutionary: he WEIGHED everything before and after chemical reactions. Everyone thought matter could be created or destroyed during reactions - things burned and disappeared, right? WRONG! Lavoisier proved that in a sealed container, the total mass NEVER changes during a reaction. He burned metals in sealed jars and showed that the metal gained EXACTLY as much weight as oxygen lost from the air. He had discovered the LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MASS: matter cannot be created or destroyed, only rearranged! This meant chemical equations must BALANCE - same atoms on both sides, just rearranged. Sadly, Lavoisier was executed during the French Revolution (politics, not science!), but his legacy lives on. His law is why we balance equations, why stoichiometry works, and why chemists can predict exactly how much product a reaction will make. It's like a recipe: if you put in 2 eggs + 3 cups flour, you can't get 10 eggs + 5 cups flour out - atoms don't magically appear or disappear!",
