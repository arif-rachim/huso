    title: 'Charles Darwin and the Voyage That Changed Everything',
    content: "It's December 27, 1831. A 22-year-old college dropout named Charles Darwin boards HMS Beagle for what he thinks will be a two-year voyage around South America. It turns into FIVE years that revolutionize science forever. In the Gal√°pagos Islands, Darwin notices something mind-blowing: each island has finches with DIFFERENT beak shapes. Seed-eating islands? Thick, strong beaks for cracking. Insect-eating islands? Long, pointed beaks for probing. Flower-nectar islands? Curved beaks for sipping. It's like the birds are CUSTOM-DESIGNED for each island! But Darwin realizes something radical: they weren't separately created - they're all RELATED, descended from a common ancestor that arrived from mainland South America. Over generations, birds with beak shapes better suited to their island's food survived and reproduced more. Poorly-suited birds died off. Nature was SELECTING the best variations - he called it 'natural selection.' For 20+ years, Darwin compiled evidence, worried about the controversy. In 1858, Alfred Russel Wallace independently discovers the same idea - Darwin rushes to publish 'On the Origin of Species' (1859). The reaction? EXPLOSIVE! But the evidence was overwhelming. Darwin showed that ALL life shares common ancestry, connected by an unbroken chain of descent going back billions of years. Today, evolution is the central organizing principle of ALL biology. Every living thing - bacteria, mushrooms, redwoods, blue whales, and YOU - is related, shaped by the same beautiful process. üåçüê¶",
