    title: 'Marcello Malpighi and the First Plant Anatomy',
    content: "In 1671, Italian physician Marcello Malpighi turned his microscope toward plants and saw something nobody had ever seen: TUBES! Tiny pipes running through stems and leaves like a plumbing system. He discovered that plants aren't just green mush - they're highly organized into specialized tissues! He found tubes carrying water up (xylem) and tubes carrying food down (phloem). But how does water climb 300 feet to the top of a redwood tree WITHOUT A PUMP? This puzzled scientists for centuries! The answer turned out to be a combination of THREE forces: (1) Root pressure pushing from below, (2) Capillary action in tiny tubes, and (3) TRANSPIRATION - evaporation from leaves PULLING water up like a giant straw! The pulling force is so strong it can lift water 400+ feet! Even more amazing: a single large tree can pull 100+ gallons of water from soil to leaves EVERY DAY. Malpighi's microscope revealed that plants are sophisticated engineering marvels with highways for water, food, and minerals!",

      title: 'Plant Tissue Organization: Meristematic vs Permanent',
      explanation: "Plants have two main tissue categories: Meristematic (growing, dividing cells at tips) and Permanent (mature, specialized cells everywhere else). Permanent tissues include parenchyma (storage), collenchyma (support), sclerenchyma (strength), xylem (water transport), and phloem (food transport).",

        description: '**MERISTEMATIC** = Construction Zones (root tips, shoot tips)\nConstantly building new cells → growth zones. Like city expanding at the edges.\n\n**PERMANENT TISSUES** = Established City:\n• **Parenchyma** = Warehouses (storage cells - store starch, water)\n• **Collenchyma** = Flexible supports (support growing parts, like scaffolding)\n• **Sclerenchyma** = Concrete pillars (strong, thick-walled dead cells for strength)\n• **Xylem** = Water pipes (carry water UP from ground)\n• **Phloem** = Food delivery trucks (carry sugar DOWN from factories/leaves)'

      title: 'Xylem & Phloem: The Vascular Highway System',
      explanation: "Xylem and phloem are vascular tissues forming a transport network. Xylem = one-way UP (water & minerals). Phloem = two-way (mainly DOWN) (sugars & nutrients). Together they\'re like a plant\'s circulatory system!",

    {
      title: 'Osmosis & Diffusion: Molecular Movement',
      explanation: "Diffusion = molecules spreading from high to low concentration. Osmosis = special case of diffusion - WATER moving across a membrane from high water concentration to low water concentration.",

    {
      title: 'Transpiration: The Pull That Lifts Water',
      explanation: "Transpiration is water evaporation from leaves through stomata (tiny pores). This creates a \"pull\" that sucks water up from roots through xylem. It's driven by three forces: root pressure (weak push), capillary action (surface tension), and transpiration pull (strongest force - evaporation creates suction).",

        type: 'Giant Straw',
        description: 'Imagine a 300-foot straw (xylem) from ground to treetop:\n• **Bottom**: Roots push water in (root pressure - weak)\n• **Middle**: Water sticks to tube walls and to itself (capillary action + cohesion)\n• **Top**: Leaves evaporate water (transpiration) creating SUCTION that PULLS the entire water column up!\n\nIt\'s like sucking on a straw - suction at top pulls liquid up. Except trees use evaporation as the "suction"!\n\nKey: Water molecules are "sticky" (cohesion) - they form a continuous chain from roots to leaves. When top molecules evaporate, they pull the chain up!'

        'A large oak tree transpires 40,000 gallons of water per YEAR!',

        'Stomata close at night (no photosynthesis, no need for CO₂) reducing water loss',
        'Desert plants have special adaptations: small leaves, sunken stomata, thick cuticles to minimize transpiration',
        'Transpiration cools leaves (like sweating cools you!) - can be 10-15°F cooler than air temperature'
      ],
      whyYouCare: 'Transpiration explains why plants wilt in heat (lose water faster than absorption), why trees make air cooler (evaporative cooling), why forests create humidity, why cutting leaves off plants helps transplanting (less transpiration), and why cacti are small-leaved!'
